# Cesar Gonzalez Portfolio

Portfolios are a great way to demonstrate professional growth, evidence of my coding skills and abilities, and showcase my best achievements. Simply put, it allows me to show and not just tell. My hope is that potential employers will be able to review my work, access my online profiles such as LinkedIn and Github, and have my contact information should they want to contact me.  <br />-

A portfolio is a living and changing collection and as such I have included placeholder images and titles. As I continue to grow in my coding experience I will add to my portfolio and make changes to it as needed. Additionally, a portfolio does not take the place of a resume thus included in this is a link to my updated resume.
